# Dart Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application built using Flutter and Dart. It provides basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /), percentage calculation (%), negation (-/), decimal input (.), and a clear (AC) and delete (D) functionality.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Percentage Calculation:** Calculate percentages easily.
* **Positive/Negative Toggle:** Quickly change the sign of the current number.
* **Decimal Input:** Enter decimal numbers for more precise calculations.
* **Clear All (AC):** Resets the display and the current expression to zero.
* **Delete (D):** Removes the last entered digit or operator.
* **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" if an invalid mathematical expression is evaluated.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive layout with large buttons for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* **Dart:** The programming language used to write Flutter applications.
* **math\_expressions Package:** An external Dart package used for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions on the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    * A connected mobile device (Android or iOS) or a running emulator/simulator.

2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3.  **Get Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    This command downloads all the necessary dependencies, including the `math_expressions` package.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    In the same terminal, run the Flutter application:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This command will build the app and install it on your connected device or running emulator/simulator.

## Usage

Simply tap the buttons on the calculator interface to perform calculations.

* **Number Buttons (0-9):** Enter digits to form numbers.
* **Operator Buttons (+, -, x, /):** Perform arithmetic operations.
* **%: ** Calculates the percentage based on the current expression.
* **-/ :** Toggles the sign of the currently displayed number.
* **. :** Enters a decimal point.
* **AC:** Clears the current display and resets the calculation.
* **D:** Deletes the last entered character.
* **=:** Evaluates the current expression and displays the result.
